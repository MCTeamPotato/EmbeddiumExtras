Magnesium Extras' license is in a mess, we have no way of knowing which of these three ([Forge MDK Rubbish LGPL-v2.1](https://github.com/anthxnymc/MagnesiumExtras/blob/1.16/LICENSE.txt), [LGPL-v3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/magnesium-extras#license) on CurseForge, [WTFPL](https://github.com/anthxnymc/MagnesiumExtras/blob/1.16/src/main/resources/META-INF/mods.toml#L12) in mods.toml) it is licensed under, so to be on the safe side, the license for this mod is also LGPL-v3.
